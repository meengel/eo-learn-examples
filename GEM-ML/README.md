# Global Earth Monitor Machine Learning Framework (GEM ML)
The purpose of the GEM framework is to tackle scale: regarding the amount of data being processed, the size of models being applied and the complexity of the logic being implemented.
Two key ingredients of such pipelines are both flexibility and standardisation.
Flexibility is especially needed for research as it usually tries to test different model architectures for the same problem without necessarily rewriting the whole code.
For that purpose, the code has to be in a way standardised such that this flexibility is possible.

Hence, the consortium established a framework fostering modularity or reusability, enable flexibility in a standardised way and to upscale the problems to relevant size.
We explicitly emphasise the word “relevant” in the sense that GEM tries to solve relevant use-cases requiring the ability to deal with a large amount of data in finite time.
In contrast to toy examples, that asks for an appropriate infrastructure.
That infrastructure is presented in the following.

## Examples
### Water Segmentation based on Sentinel-1 (WaterSegmentation)
### NDVI Prediction based on Sentinel-2 (Treecurrent)
